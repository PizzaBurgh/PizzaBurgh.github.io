# Pizzaburgh.github.io
I made this website initially for a project for my web design course in the Fall of 2016, from there I decided I wanted to keep the website to host photographs I take to share with friends and family. For now it's a simple html page with some css/js, used bootstrap to help make a clean mobile page. Learning through trial and error.


#2018 UPDATE
This repo is currently the "test" for my website, it's a little outdated. I am currently working on a finishing up the last touches on my new site rebuild! Tons of new photos to come.
